    "# Explainable Retrieval in Document Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements an Explainable Retriever, a system that not only retrieves relevant documents based on a query but also provides explanations for why each retrieved document is relevant. It combines vector-based similarity search with natural language explanations, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of the retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional document retrieval systems often work as black boxes, providing results without explaining why they were chosen. This lack of transparency can be problematic in scenarios where understanding the reasoning behind the results is crucial. The Explainable Retriever addresses this by offering insights into the relevance of each retrieved document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vector store creation from input texts\n",
    "2. Base retriever using Chroma for efficient similarity search\n",
    "3. Language model (LLM) for generating explanations\n",
    "4. Custom ExplainableRetriever class that combines retrieval and explanation generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing and Vector Store Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input texts are converted into embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model.\n",
    "2. A Chroma vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retriever Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A base retriever is created from the vector store, configured to return the top 5 most similar documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An LLM (AzureChatOpenAI) is used to generate explanations.\n",
    "2. A custom prompt template is defined to guide the LLM in explaining the relevance of retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ExplainableRetriever Class\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combines the base retriever and explanation generation into a single interface.\n",
    "2. The `retrieve_and_explain` method:\n",
    "   - Retrieves relevant documents using the base retriever.\n",
    "   - For each retrieved document, generates an explanation of its relevance to the query.\n",
    "   - Returns a list of dictionaries containing both the document content and its explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transparency: Users can understand why specific documents were retrieved.\n",
    "2. Trust: Explanations build user confidence in the system's results.\n",
    "3. Learning: Users can gain insights into the relationships between queries and documents.\n",
    "4. Debugging: Easier to identify and correct issues in the retrieval process.\n",
    "5. Customization: The explanation prompt can be tailored for different use cases or domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Explainable Retriever represents a significant step towards more interpretable and trustworthy information retrieval systems. By providing natural language explanations alongside retrieved documents, it bridges the gap between powerful vector-based search techniques and human understanding. This approach has potential applications in various fields where the reasoning behind information retrieval is as important as the retrieved information itself, such as legal research, medical information systems, and educational tools."

      "Result 1:\n",
      "Content: The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere.\n",
      "Explanation: The relationship between the query \"Why is the sky blue?\" and the retrieved context \"The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere.\" is direct and explanatory. The context is highly relevant to the query as it addresses the fundamental reason behind the color of the sky, which is the interaction of sunlight with the Earth's atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how the context helps answer the query:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Relevance**: The context immediately responds to the query by stating the cause of the sky's blue color.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Scientific Basis**: It hints at a scientific explanation involving sunlight and the atmosphere, which is essential for a deeper understanding. The interaction mentioned likely refers to the scattering of light, specifically Rayleigh scattering, which causes shorter (blue) wavelengths of light to scatter more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Foundation for Further Explanation**: While the context provides a brief answer, it sets the stage for a more detailed explanation. For instance, one could elaborate on how molecules and small particles in the atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions, and blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in shorter, smaller waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the context is relevant because it directly answers the query and provides a starting point for a more detailed scientific explanation of why the sky appears blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result 2:\n",
      "Content: The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere.\n",
      "Explanation: The query \"Why is the sky blue?\" seeks an explanation for the color of the sky. The retrieved context provides a direct and relevant answer by stating, \"The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relevance of the Context:\n",
      "1. **Direct Answer**: The context directly addresses the query by offering an explanation that sunlight and atmospheric interaction are responsible for the sky's blue color.\n",
      "2. **Foundational Information**: It sets the stage for a more detailed scientific explanation. By mentioning sunlight and the atmosphere, it hints at the underlying physical processes involved, such as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How It Helps Answer the Query:\n",
      "- **Introduction to the Concept**: The context introduces the fundamental concept that the color of the sky is related to how sunlight interacts with the atmosphere. This is a crucial starting point for a deeper dive into the specific mechanisms.\n",
      "- **Guidance for Further Inquiry**: Knowing that the interaction between sunlight and the atmosphere is key, the inquirer can further explore specific phenomena like scattering of light, which explains why shorter wavelengths (blue light) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red light).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "The provided context is highly relevant to the query as it gives a concise and accurate starting point for understanding why the sky is blue. It addresses the query directly and sets up a foundation for further detailed exploration of the scientific principles involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result 3:\n",
      "Content: The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere.\n",
      "Explanation: The query \"Why is the sky blue?\" is asking for a scientific explanation for the blue color of the sky. The retrieved context, \"The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere,\" is directly relevant to the query because it provides the fundamental reason behind the phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "To elaborate, the context hints at the concept of Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles, scattering in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the context is relevant because it points to the interaction between sunlight and the atmosphere as the cause of the sky's blue color. It helps answer the query by providing a starting point for a more detailed explanation, which would involve discussing the scattering of light and the specific properties of blue light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result 4:\n",
      "Content: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce energy.\n",
      "Explanation: The query \"Why is the sky blue?\" is asking for an explanation related to atmospheric science and the scattering of light. Specifically, it is looking for an explanation of Rayleigh scattering, which is the phenomenon that causes the sky to appear blue during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided context, \"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce energy,\" is relevant to the field of biology and plant science. Photosynthesis involves the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll in plants to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "While both the query and the context involve sunlight, their relevance to each other is minimal in terms of directly answering the query. The context does not provide information about atmospheric conditions, light scattering, or the specific reasons why the sky appears blue. Instead, it focuses on the biological process of photosynthesis, which is unrelated to the query about the color of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "To directly answer the query, one would need information about how sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Specifically, an explanation would involve the scattering of shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) by the molecules and small particles in the atmosphere, which makes the sky appear blue to the human eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the context mentions sunlight, it does not address the atmospheric science needed to explain why the sky is blue. Therefore, it is not relevant to answering the query directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result 5:\n",
      "Content: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce energy.\n",
      "Explanation: The query \"Why is the sky blue?\" is asking for an explanation related to atmospheric science and the scattering of light. The context provided, \"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce energy,\" pertains to a biological process in plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevance:\n",
      "The context is not directly relevant to the query. Photosynthesis and the color of the sky involve different scientific principles and domains. Photosynthesis is a biological process that occurs in plants, while the color of the sky is determined by the scattering of sunlight by molecules and small particles in the Earth's atmosphere, a concept explained by Rayleigh scattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it might help:\n",
      "While the context does not directly answer the query, it does mention sunlight, which is a common factor in both photosynthesis and the color of the sky. This tangential connection can be used as a starting point to explain that sunlight is composed of different wavelengths of light, and when it enters the Earth's atmosphere, shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red and yellow). This scattering causes the sky to appear blue to the human eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the context is not directly relevant but mentions sunlight, which is a key element in explaining why the sky is blue.\n",
